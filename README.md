## Things not done properly and for improvement because lack of time
- removed hardcoded strings into Translation_keys
- footer
- ClientNote with image and text can be a 1 component instead of 2 but it was defined like this on the design
- Figma font not available to download ( used Lato instead )
- Not 1:1 with the design because lack of time and lack of defined design system
